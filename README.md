## Image Analysis and Computer Vision Stable (IACV) Diffusion 2 Showcase

This repository is used to give a quick presentation of Stable Diffusion 2, Dreambooth Finetuning and Upscaling during the IACV lecture.

### Usage:
Getting started is super easy. 
- Navigate to [this repository](https://github.com/Jan-Oliver/ETH-IACV-SD2)
- You can then either clone download the whole repository to your local machine.
- For cloning run
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Jan-Oliver/ETH-IACV-SD2.git
    ```
- For downloading use the green `<Code>` button
- Now [Open Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
- Click on "File" -> "Open Notebook" and select the Notebook "SD2_Showcase.ipynb".

**Note**: Make sure to use a GPU (this is for free in colab).
- Select "Runtime" in the colab menu and then select "Change runtime type".
- In the popup window select as "Hardware Accelerator" -> "GPU" and hit `save`.

**NOTE**: Make sure to prepare your images in advance as Colab GPU only is available for about 3 hours and we don't want to waste precious GPU compute time.
- Select about 10-15 images where only yourself is visible and Crop them to 512x512 using e.g. a tool such as [this](https://www.birme.net/?target_width=512&target_height=512&auto_focal=false)
